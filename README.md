# might_and_magic_duel_game
  A turn based duel game , which is text based, written on python. Player fights with cpu in this game, each character type has 3 skills, 1 skill and attack is allowed at each turn. Type character name to start game, type "1","2" or "3" to use one of 3 skills, type "attack" to attack your opponent till someone gets died .
  
  Note that the game still lacks of some mechanisms and lacks of balance between characters. It's open to contribution-new ideas and improvement :)
